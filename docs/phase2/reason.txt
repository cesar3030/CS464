The database schema for our project has changed a little bit from the previous version. We added surrogate key attributes to the entities Companies and Deliveries. And instead of using an attribute “addressID” on the entity set Deliveries we added a relationship “shippedTo” to the entity set Addresses to reduce the redundancy. Also a  new entity set Items which is in one to one correspondence with the Products entity has been added to the schema to let the user to select the quantity of the items they are looking for. Our first version was missing a many-to-one relationship between addresses and users so we fixed it in that new version.
